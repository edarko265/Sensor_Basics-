# 🏥 Remote Patient Monitoring & Alarm System (Sensor Basics)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Remote Patient Monitoring and Alarm System using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as the core computing unit. The system integrates various sensors and technologies to       enhance patient safety and real-time monitoring. As part of Sensor basics course.

## 📡 Key Components

  SIR (Sound Intensity Recognition) – Detects abnormal sounds like distress calls.
  IR (Infrared Sensor) – Monitors movement and presence detection.
  Magnetic Contact Sensor – Detects door or equipment access.
  LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – Monitors ambient light levels.
  Laser Lights – Used for intrusion detection and alert mechanisms.

## 🔧 Features

  ✅ Real-time Patient Monitoring – Tracks patient movements, environment, and potential distress signals.
  ✅ Automated Alerts – Sends notifications upon detecting anomalies (e.g., falls, unusual sounds, unauthorized access).
  ✅ Secure Data Processing – Uses Raspberry Pi 3B+ for handling sensor data efficiently.
  ✅ IoT-Enabled – Allows remote access and monitoring via a connected dashboard.
